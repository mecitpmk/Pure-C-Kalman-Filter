# Pure-C-Kalman-Filter

This repo, based on https://github.com/TKJElectronics/KalmanFilter

##You can use this repo in your Real Embedded Systems. It's coded with Pure C.

In this repo, I'll try to based on macro expansion (preprocessor) to make the program much more faster and memory optimized.

But if you dont want to use preprocessor form , you just have to comment line in kalman.h  which is "#define USE_MACRO_EXPANSION 1"
